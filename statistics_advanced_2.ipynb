        "  # Hypothesis testing is a statistical method used to determine whether there is enough evidence in a sample data to infer that a certain condition or assumption (the hypothesis) is true for the entire population. It's a formal procedure to decide between two competing hypotheses:\n",
        "      1.  Null Hypothesis (H₀): This is the default assumption, often stating there is no effect or no difference.\n",
        "      \n",
        "      2.Alternative Hypothesis (H₁ or Ha): This is what you are trying to prove, suggesting there is an effect or a difference.\n",

        "  # Goal: The goal of hypothesis testing is to determine whether there is enough evidence to reject the null hypothesis in favor of the alternative hypothesis.\n",
        "  # Decision: The decision in hypothesis testing is either to \"reject the null hypothesis\" or \"fail to reject the null hypothesis.\" We do not \"accept the alternative hypothesis\" directly; we conclude that there is enough evidence to support it by rejecting the null.\n",
        "  # Nature of Statement: The null hypothesis often represents a statement of no change or no effect, while the alternative hypothesis represents a statement of change, difference, or effect.\n",

        " 3: Explain the significance level in hypothesis testing and its role in deciding the outcome of a test.\n",
        "   # The significance level, often denoted by the Greek letter alpha (α), is a crucial concept in hypothesis testing. It represents the probability of making a Type I error, which is the error of rejecting the null hypothesis when it is actually true.\n",
        "   Here's a breakdown of its role:\n",
        "\n",
        "    # Threshold for Decision: The significance level acts as a threshold for deciding whether to reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "    # Defining the Rejection Region: It helps define the rejection region in the distribution of the test statistic. If the calculated test statistic falls within this rejection region, we reject the null hypothesis.\n",
        "    # Balancing Type I and Type II Errors: Choosing a significance level involves a trade-off between Type I errors (rejecting a true null hypothesis) and Type II errors (failing to reject a false null hypothesis). A lower significance level reduces the risk of a Type I error but increases the risk of a Type II error.\n",
        "    #Interpreting the P-value: The significance level is compared to the p-value (the probability of observing the data if the null hypothesis is true).\n",
        "      # If the p-value is less than or equal to the significance level (p ≤ α), we reject the null hypothesis. This means that the observed data is unlikely to have occurred by random chance if the null hypothesis were true.\n",
        "      # If the p-value is greater than the significance level (p > α), we fail to reject the null hypothesis. This means that the observed data is reasonably likely to have occurred by random chance if the null hypothesis were true.\n",
        "Commonly used significance levels are 0.05 (or 5%) and 0.01 (or 1%). A significance level of 0.05 means that there is a 5% chance of incorrectly rejecting the null hypothesis when it is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "In summary, the significance level is a pre-determined probability that helps researchers decide how much evidence is needed to reject the null hypothesis and conclude that there is a statistically significant result. It sets the standard for how willing you are to accept the risk of a Type I error.\n",
